Unlike traditional methods that split text based on fixed character or word counts, semantic chunking aims to create more meaningful and context-aware text segments.\n","\n","## Motivation\n","\n","Traditional text splitting methods often break documents at arbitrary points, potentially disrupting the flow of information and context. Semantic chunking addresses this issue by attempting to split text at more natural breakpoints, preserving semantic coherence within each chunk.\n","\n","## Key Components\n","\n","1. PDF processing and text extraction\n","2. Semantic chunking using LangChain's SemanticChunker\n","3. Vector store creation using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings\n","4. Retriever setup for querying the processed documents\n","\n","## Method Details\n","\n","### Document Preprocessing\n","\n","1. The PDF is read and converted to a string using a custom `read_pdf_to_string` function.\n","\n","### Semantic Chunking\n","\n","1. Utilizes LangChain's `SemanticChunker` with OpenAI embeddings.\n","2. Three breakpoint types are available:\n","   - 'percentile': Splits at differences greater than the X percentile.\n","   - 'standard_deviation': Splits at differences greater than X standard deviations.\n","   - 'interquartile': Uses the interquartile distance to determine split points.\n","3. In this implementation, the 'percentile' method is used with a threshold of 90.\n","\n","### Vector Store Creation\n","\n","1. OpenAI embeddings are used to create vector representations of the semantic chunks.\n","2. A FAISS vector store is created from these embeddings for efficient similarity search.\n","\n","### Retriever Setup\n","\n","1. A retriever is configured to fetch the top 2 most relevant chunks for a given query.\n","\n","## Key Features\n","\n","1. Context-Aware Splitting: Attempts to maintain semantic coherence within chunks.\n","2. Flexible Configuration: Allows for different breakpoint types and thresholds.\n","3. Integration with Advanced NLP Tools: Uses OpenAI embeddings for both chunking and retrieval.\n","\n","## Benefits of this Approach\n","\n","1. Improved Coherence: Chunks are more likely to contain complete thoughts or ideas.\n","2. Better Retrieval Relevance: By preserving context, retrieval accuracy may be enhanced.\n","3. Adaptability: The chunking method can be adjusted based on the nature of the documents and retrieval needs.\n","4. Potential for Better Understanding: LLMs or downstream tasks may perform better with more coherent text segments.\n","\n","## Implementation Details\n","\n","1. Uses OpenAI's embeddings for both the semantic chunking process and the final vector representations.\n","2. Employs FAISS for creating an efficient searchable index of the chunks.\n","3. The retriever is set up to return the top 2 most relevant chunks, which can be adjusted as needed.\n","\n","## Example Usage\n","\n","The code includes a test query: \"What is the main cause of climate change?\". This demonstrates how the semantic chunking and retrieval system can be used to find relevant information from the processed document.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","Semantic chunking represents an advanced approach to document processing for retrieval systems. By attempting to maintain semantic coherence within text segments, it has the potential to improve the quality of retrieved information and enhance the performance of downstream NLP tasks. This technique is particularly valuable for processing long, complex documents where maintaining context is crucial, such as scientific papers, legal documents, or comprehensive reports."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qLx-j7QA7w4C"},"source":["<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","\n","<img src=\"../images/semantic_chunking_comparison.svg\" alt=\"Self RAG\" style=\"width:100%; height:auto;\">\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7lw10MOy7w4D"},"source":["# Package Installation and Imports\n","\n","The cell below installs all necessary packages required to run this notebook.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Install required packages\n","!pip install -qU langchain langchain-community langchain-openai \\\n","    langchain-text-splitters langchain-core faiss-cpu \\\n","    pymupdf rank_bm25 deepeval pydantic \\\n","    langchain-experimental langchain-openai python-dotenv langchain-huggingface sentence-transformers langchain-groq"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"-bPURVGyAjs3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"id":"P0dFrog_7w4E","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769135087321,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":113,"user":{"displayName":"Chương Cao","userId":"13396380722713407632"}},"outputId":"482d662d-7ea7-4658-d443-fb63faa1ae27"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["fatal: destination path 'RAG_TECHNIQUES' already exists and is not an empty directory.\n"]}],"source":["# Clone the repository to access helper functions and evaluation modules\n","!git clone https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_TECHNIQUES.git\n","import sys\n","sys.path.append('RAG_TECHNIQUES')\n","# If you need to run with the latest data\n","# !cp -r RAG_TECHNIQUES/data ."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"collapsed":true,"id":"0x7cFHK47w4E","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769135119544,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":32221,"user":{"displayName":"Chương Cao","userId":"13396380722713407632"}},"outputId":"4b0390e6-2673-4fb1-d0d9-0d3f088931df"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["WARNING:torchao.kernel.intmm:Warning: Detected no triton, on systems without Triton certain kernels will not work\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Loaded successfully\n"]}],"source":["import os\n","import sys\n","from dotenv import load_dotenv\n","\n","# Load environment variables from a .env file first\n","load_dotenv()\n","\n","# Set the OpenAI API key environment variable immediately\n","# os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')\n","# os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_BASE\"] = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_BASE')\n","\n","# Original path append replaced for Colab compatibility\n","from helper_functions import *\n","from evalute_rag import *\n","\n","from langchain_experimental.text_splitter import SemanticChunker\n","from langchain_openai.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings\n","\n","\n","print(\"Loaded successfully\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rRX4mThY7w4E"},"source":["### Define file path"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N95NL56p7w4F","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769135119851,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":292,"user":{"displayName":"Chương Cao","userId":"13396380722713407632"}},"outputId":"355a0566-2414-4d31-da25-7e1948ec296e","collapsed":true},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2026-01-23 02:25:19--  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NirDiamant/RAG_TECHNIQUES/main/data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf\n","Resolving raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)... 185.199.108.133, 185.199.109.133, 185.199.110.133, ...\n","Connecting to raw.githubusercontent.com (raw.githubusercontent.com)|185.199.108.133|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 206372 (202K) [application/octet-stream]\n","Saving to: ‘data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf’\n","\n","data/Understanding_ 100%[===================>] 201.54K  --.-KB/s    in 0.03s   \n","\n","2026-01-23 02:25:19 (7.57 MB/s) -

The term \n","\"global climate\" encompasses the planet's overall weather patterns, including temperature, \n","precipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past century, human \n","activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \n","contributed to climate change. Historical Context \n","The Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \n","been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \n","11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth's orbit that \n","change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \n","began at the end of the last ice age, human societies flourished, but the industrial era has seen \n","unprecedented changes. Modern Observations \n","Modern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \n","and extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \n","documented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \n","provide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \n","predict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \n","driven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases. Chapter 2: Causes of Climate Change \n","Greenhouse Gases \n","The primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \n","atmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \n","oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is essential \n","for life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \n","activities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate. Fossil Fuels \n","Burning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \n","natural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \n","the beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \n","today. Coal \n","Coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, and its use for electricity generation is a major \n","source of CO2 emissions. Despite a decline in some regions, coal remains a significant \n","energy source globally. It is mined extensively in countries like China, India, and the United \n","States, contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints. Oil \n","Oil is used primarily for transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The combustion of \n","oil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate \n","change and air quality issues. The global oil industry is vast, involving extraction, refining, \n","and distribution, with significant geopolitical and economic implications. Natural Gas \n","Natural gas is the least carbon-intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a \"bridge fuel\" to a \n","lower-carbon future. However, its extraction and use still contribute to greenhouse gas \n","emissions, particularly methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas.\n","\n","\n","Context 2:\n","This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles and agricultural \n","practices. Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels \n","Warmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising \n","sea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, \n","threatening coastal communities and ecosystems. Polar Ice Melt \n","The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, leading to significant ice \n","loss. Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \n","affects global ocean currents and weather patterns. Glacial Retreat \n","Glaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. Regions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \n","particular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture. Coastal Erosion \n","Rising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \n","homes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low-lying islands and coastal regions are especially \n","vulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like sea walls and \n","managed retreats. Extreme Weather Events \n","Climate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather \n","events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can have \n","devastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems. Hurricanes and Typhoons \n","Warmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons, leading to more \n","destructive storms. Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding. Early \n","warning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these risks. Droughts \n","Increased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent \n","and severe droughts. This affects agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems, particularly in \n","arid and semi-arid regions. Droughts can lead to food and water shortages and exacerbate \n","conflicts. Flooding \n","Heavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to increased flooding.\n","\n","\n"]}],"source":["test_query = \"What is the main cause of climate change?\"\n","context = retrieve_context_per_question(test_query, chunks_query_retriever)\n","show_context(context)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"FSUk4S4s7w4G"},"outputs":[],"source":["text_splitter = SemanticChunker(OpenAIEmbeddings(base_url=\"https://llm.ptnglobalcorp.com\"), breakpoint_threshold_type='percentile', breakpoint_threshold_amount=90) # chose which embeddings and breakpoint type and threshold to use"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"AyrnBIcM7w4G"},"source":["### Split original text to semantic chunks"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZAXK5G5u7w4G"},"source":["### Create vector store and retriever"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5jOcBdF-7w4G"},"source":["### Test the retriever"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bXB5oUYa7w4H"},"source":["![](https://europe-west1-rag-techniques-views-tracker.cloudfunctions.net/rag-techniques-tracker?notebook=all-rag-techniques--semantic-chunking)"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":["xq0Due9M7w39"]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
